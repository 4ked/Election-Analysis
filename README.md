# Election-Analysis

Our group is creating an interactive map of the 2020 presidential election results. The goal is to show common statistics such as party victories by state and their victory percentage ratios, but also more information such as votes over time.

## Tech Stack

- Cloud Hosting: Heroku
- Backend: Node.js
- Database: Postgres
- Data API: State Government Web Pages
- Frontend: Javascript + HTML/CSS

## Setup Development Environment

To build the project from your local machine you need to setup the node.js environment properly.

### Step One: Install node.js

Download node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en/). npm is a Node package manager that gives us tools to allow our server to run effectively. To ensure node was installed properly, open up the command line and type the following command below to check your current node version:

```sh
node -v
```

### Step Two: Install node.js

Move into the root/backend directory, and initialize the environment by typing:

```sh
npm install
```
